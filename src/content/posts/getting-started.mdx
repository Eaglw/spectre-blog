Have you ever found an old smart bulb, plugged it in, and... nothing? No light, no flicker, no sign of life. That was exactly my situation. At first, I was ready to toss it, but curiosity got the best of me. A quick search online led me down a rabbit hole of smart bulb repair, where people managed to fix their bulbs by removing faulty LEDs. Intrigued, I decided to give it a shot.

## The Disassembly Struggle

Opening the bulb turned out to be the hardest part. I tried prying it open carefully, but let’s be real—I ended up applying way too much force with a knife. After some struggle (and avoiding injury, luckily), I finally managed to open it up.

With the bulb exposed, I followed a simple trick: instead of painstakingly identifying and removing bad LEDs, I pressed all of them down with a piece of wood to ensure proper contact. No graphite, no rewiring, just pressure—and miraculously, the bulb turned on! Problem solved? Not quite.

## The Smart Home Integration Roadblock

Excited, I added the bulb back to its app, only to discover a frustrating change: the manufacturer had removed LAN control. This meant I could no longer integrate it with Home Assistant directly. Not one to give up, I went back to searching for solutions.

That’s when I found [this excellent project](https://github.com/ApplY3D/mi-home-toolkit), which allows you to log into your Mi account and re-enable LAN control. Everything looked promising, except for one issue: macOS didn’t want me running an unverified executable.

## The Final Battle and Victory

After some back-and-forth, disabling security warnings, and convincing macOS to cooperate, I finally got the toolkit running. With LAN control enabled, my resurrected bulb was now fully accessible via Home Assistant—just like the good old days.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Don’t assume dead electronics are beyond repair.** A little troubleshooting can go a long way.
2. **Opening smart devices isn’t always straightforward.** Be patient, and maybe don’t use excessive force like I did.
3. **Manufacturers love taking away useful features.** Thankfully, the community always finds a workaround.
What started as a simple repair attempt turned into a fun project that reminded me why I love tinkering with smart home devices.
